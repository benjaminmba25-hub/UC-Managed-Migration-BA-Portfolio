# Universal Credit Managed Migration: BA Portfolio

**Educational Simulation | Business Analysis & Transformation**

This repository demonstrates Business Analysis delivery for DWP's legacy-to-Universal 
Credit migration programme (2.8m claimants), focusing on:

- ✅ **Process Optimisation**: Eliminating "swivel chair" inefficiencies via API integration
- ✅ **Complex Eligibility**: Gherkin BDD for Transitional Protection calculations
- ✅ **Cloud Transformation**: Legacy-to-cloud data migration specifications
- ✅ **GDS Governance**: Risk registers and Service Assessment readiness

## 🎯 Business Challenge
Current "swivel chair" processes require agents to manually check 4+ systems 
(JSAPS mainframe, Local Authority portals, HMRC Gateway), causing delays in 
managed migration. This portfolio proposes an API-first architecture.
